    <h3>Nathan: <br>I spent this week mostly watching. I brainstormed with Bill for a bit about what we wanted to do, and we started making a list of the stuff we wanted to be in our film. Eventually, we will cut down the wish list to a list of things that we can actually afford to put into our film (with time and resource constraints and all). The list is in the &#8217;Brainstorming&#8217; document in our shared folder. I watched a few 20 minute silent films, and those were very interesting because of how much the actors had to pantomime to get their points across. They were surprisingly effective, and I have a weird newfound respect for silent films now. I also watched parts of Enter the Dragon (with Bruce Lee), since I wanted some inspiration for an action sequence. I wasn&#8217;t really a fan of how there wasn&#8217;t much buildup in the fight scenes, and how Bruce Lee almost always instantly won. If Bill and I were to do an action scene, I would probably go for more of an even fight with more motives.<br><br>Bill: <br>This week, I focused on one film in particular, Ikiru. While not filled with action shots, this Kurosawa film focused on a man who was diagnosed with terminal cancer who tries to find meaning in the numbered days he has left. I was able to find some interesting shots that I thought could be implemented into our own film as well as those I found to just be all-around effective. Shots that use a mirror to be able to see front-facing views on both characters while they are directly facing each other and the use of a jungle gym as a prison proves incredibly effective and something we can aspire to have in our own film. Along with Nathan, we also watched some silent films and gained an appreciation for expression without words (some of the films went a little far to a point of comedy, and that&#8217s not for us, but the point is still there). As Nathan stated, we spent some time brainstorming on ideas and coming up with a general direction. We have already expressed interest in logistics of our film (such as having an action scene and focusing less on dialogue) and feel confident in our ability to compose a fully-fledged proposal by Friday.
